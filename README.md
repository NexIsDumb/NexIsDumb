# Hey! Welcome to my Readme!
Just a random italian dumbass furry who likes coding and who started coding for passion and passion only thanks to school. ;3<br/>
I'm ***very*** stubborn besides also being Bi and taken. <3

## Interests
Obliviously coding but also many other aspects of Informatics like Robotics and much more.<br/>
Placing aside professionalism, I **LOVE** videogames, I mainly started coding because of those, specially Horror games since it's my favorite genre.

## Contacts
Here's my [linktree](https://linktr.ee/just_nex).<br/>
You can also find me in many communities but mainly the [Codename Engine](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs) one that I'm also one of the main developers and a moderator of.

## Stats
I can use a bunch of languages (even if some aren't displayed in here) and willing to learn more, afterall the more the better!<br/>
